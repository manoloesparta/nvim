# Neovim configuration

Just a plain configuration for neovim to my likings.

Steps to use this configuration:

1. Install packer into your system, [use this quickstart](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)
2. Clone this repo and make a symbolic link to `~/.config/nvim`
3. Open Neovim, skip the errors and execute `:PackerSync`, you might need to repeat this
